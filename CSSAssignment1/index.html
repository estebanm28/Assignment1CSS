        <div class="verse1"> 
            There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold <br>
            And she's buying a stairway to Heaven <br>
            When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed <br>
            With a word she can get what she came for <br>
            Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven <br>
            There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure <br>
            'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings <br>
            In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings <br>
            Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven <br>
            

        </div>

        <div class="chorus"> 
            <i> Ooh, it makes me wonder </i><br> 
            <i>Ooh, makes me wonder </i><br>

        </div>

        <div class="verse2"> 
            There's a feeling I get when I look to the West <br> 
            And my spirit is crying for leaving <br>
            In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees <br>
            And the voices of those who stand looking <br> 
        </div>


        <div class="chorus"> 
            <i> Ooh, it makes me wonder </i> <br> 
            <i> Ooh, makes me wonder </i> <br> 

        <div class="verse3">
            And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune <br>
            Then the piper will lead us to reason <br>
            And a new day will dawn for those who stand long <br>
            And the forests will echo with laughter <br> 
        </div>

        <div class = "chorus"> 
            <i> Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh </i>
        </div>


        <div class="verse4">
        If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now <br>
        It's just a spring clean for the May queen <br>
        Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run <br> 
        There's still time to change the road you're on <br>
        </div>

        <div class = "chorus"> 
        <i> And it makes me wonder </i><br>
        <i>  Ohh, woah </i><br>
            </div>

        <div class="verse5">
        Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know <br>
        The piper's calling you to join him <br> 
        Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know <br> 
        Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? <br>
        </div>

        <div class="bridge">
        And as we wind on down the road <br> 
        Our shadows taller than our soul <br> 
        There walks a lady we all know <br> 
        Who shines white light and wants to show <br> 
        How everything still turns to gold <br> 
        And if you listen very hard <br> 
        The tune will come to you at last <br> 
        When all are one, and one is all <br> 
        To be a rock and not to roll <br>
        </div>
        
        <div class="Outro" > 
            And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
